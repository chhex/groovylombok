Two scenarios 

* Java Lombok annotated Classes consumed from Groovy, see https://github.com/chhex/groovylombok/blob/main/src/test/groovy/ch/chesnb/beans/lombok/GroovyLombokTests.groovy

* Groovy Lombok annotaed Class. 

The first works without problems
The second -> The Lombok Annotations are ignored by Groovy. The Test Here the Test "Groovy class with Lombok annotation doesn't work" fails
